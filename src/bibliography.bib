  This formalism was developed by Alonzo Church as a tool for studying the
  mathematical properties of effectively computable functions. The formalism
  became popular and has provided a strong theoretical foundation for the family
  of functional programming languages. This tutorial shows how to perform
  arithmetical and logical computations using the $\lambda$-calculus and how to
  define recursive functions, even though $\lambda$-calculus functions are
  unnamed and thus cannot refer explicitly to themselves.},

    abstract={The paper defines the linked data as a set of best practices that are used to publish data on the web using a machine; the technology (or mode of realization) of linked data is associated with the concept of the semantic web. It is the area of the semantic web, or web of data, as defined by Tim Berners-Lee "A web of things in the world, described by data on the web". The paper highlights the continuities and differences between semantic web and web traditional, or web documents. The analysis of linked data takes place within the world of libraries, archives and museums, traditionally committed to high standards for structuring and sharing of data. The data, in fact, assume the role of generating quality information for the network. The production of linked data requires compliance with rules and the use of specific technologies and languages, especially in the case of publication of linked data in open mode. The production cycle of linked data may be the track, or a guideline, for institutions that wish to join projects to publish their data. Data quality is assessed through a rating system designed by Tim Berners-Lee.},

    abstract = {With more substantial funding from research organizations and industry, numerous large-scale applications, and recently developed technologies, the Semantic Web is quickly emerging as a well-recognized and important area of computer science. While Semantic Web technologies are still rapidly evolving, Foundations of Semantic Web Technologies focuses on the established foundations in this area that have become relatively stable over time. It thoroughly covers basic introductions and intuitions, technical details, and formal foundations.The book concentrates on Semantic Web technologies standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium: RDF and SPARQL enable data exchange and querying, RDFS and OWL provide expressive ontology modeling, and RIF supports rule-based modeling. The text also describes methods for specifying, querying, and reasoning with ontological information. In addition, it explores topics that are clearly beyond foundations, such as tools, applications, and engineering aspects.Written by highly respected researchers with a deep understanding of the material, this text centers on the formal specifications of the subject and supplies many pointers that are useful for employing Semantic Web technologies in practice.Updates, errata, slides for teaching, and links to further resources are available at http://semantic-web-book.org/}

    abstract="Reasonable Ontology Templates () is a language for representing ontology modelling patterns in the form of parameterised ontologies. Ontology templates are simple and powerful abstractions useful for constructing, interacting with, and maintaining ontologies. With ontology templates, modelling patterns can be uniquely identified and encapsulated, broken down into convenient and manageable pieces, instantiated, and used as queries. Formal relations defined over templates support sophisticated maintenance tasks for sets of templates, such as revealing redundancies and suggesting new templates for representing implicit patterns. Ontology templates are designed for practical use; an vocabulary, convenient serialisation formats for the semantic web and for terse specification of template definitions and bulk instances are available, including an open source implementation for using templates. Our approach is successfully tested on a real-world large-scale ontology in the engineering domain.",

    abstract = {Data in engineering industries is highly standardized and information-dense, and usually distributed across many different sources with incompatible formats and implicit semantics. As such, it provides an ideal use case for application of semantic technologies for data integration and access. However, adoption of semantic technologies is hampered due to the complex set of competencies required to construct a scalable and maintainable ontology. We present a methodology for aiding domain experts and ontology engineers in constructing and maintaining industry-viable ontologies using a template-based approach for ontology modeling and instantiation. Using the OTTR framework, the structure of the input formats and the semantics of the target domain are modeled and maintained in separate modularized template libraries. Data provided by domain experts is mapped to these templates, allowing end-users to extend and amend the model without the need to directly interact with semantic technology languages and tools.Our approach is demonstrated on a real-world use case from the asset maintenance domain which has applicability to a wide range of industries.},
